# 🍔 Food Delivery Data Analysis

## 👋 Introduction
Welcome to my Data Analysis project! In this project, I have analyzed a real-world dataset from a food delivery platform. The goal was to understand customer behavior, identify the most profitable cities and cuisines, and see how "Gold" memberships affect revenue.

## 📂 Files in this Repository
* **`analysis.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code, data merging, and analysis.
* **`orders.csv`**: Contains all the order transactions (dates, amounts, IDs).
* **`users.json`**: Contains user profiles (names, cities, membership status).
* **`restaurants.sql`**: Contains restaurant details (names, cuisine types, ratings).
* **`final_food_delivery_dataset.csv`**: The final combined dataset generated by the code (created after running the notebook).

## 🛠️ How It Works
The project follows these simple steps:
1.  **Load Data**: Reads the CSV, JSON, and SQL files into Python using Pandas.
2.  **Clean & Merge**: Combines all three files into one master dataset (`final_food_delivery_dataset.csv`) using `user_id` and `restaurant_id`.
3.  **Analyze**: Answers key business questions, such as:
    * Which city makes the most money?
    * Do Gold members spend more?
    * Which cuisines are the most popular?

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  Download this repository to your computer.
2.  Make sure you have **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook** installed.
3.  Open the file `analysis.ipynb`.
4.  Click **"Run All"** to execute the code.
5.  Watch the results appear and check your folder for the new CSV file!

## 📊 Key Findings
* **Top City:** Chennai generates the highest revenue from Gold members.
* **Best Cuisine:** Mexican food has the highest Average Order Value.
* **Peak Time:** The 3rd Quarter (July–Sept) sees the most sales.
